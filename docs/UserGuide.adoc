== Introduction

ClubHub (CH) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing members, inventory, finances and events in their club*. More importantly, CH is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CH can get your club management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ClubHub.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
