Project: Club Hub

== Overview

=== 1.    Project Background and Description

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|image:image004.png[Tip icon,width=15,height=15] |Club Hub is
a desktop address book application designed for University interest
group/club leaders as its primary users. This application aims to help
these leaders better manage their members, finances, calendar, and
inventory. The user interacts with the program using a Command Line
Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphic User Interface (GUI) created with
JavaFX. It is written in Java and has about 10 thousand lines of codes.

|=======================================================================
|image:image004.png[Tip icon,width=15,height=15] a|
Major enhancements: implemented the Club Account feature

-        Function 1: adding or removing a ledger record.

o   What it does: allows the user to easily add and remove ledgers
according to the date in the format [DD/MM].

o   Justification: This function improves the management of finances in
the club by allowing records to be add and removed via the date, to
ensure maximum clarity and unambiguity when it comes to recording
finances.

-        Function 2: crediting or debiting balance from a ledger record.

o   What it does: allows the user to credit or debit the amount on a
specific date.

o   Justification: This function improves the product significantly
because a user can easily update their spending on a specific date or
their contributions to the club with just one line of command. In
addition, working directly with dates instead of indexes ensures maximum
clarity in managing the finances.

-        Highlights: This enhancement affects and manipulates existing
data stored in the memory. It required an in-depth analysis of design
considerations to allow mathematical operations to be performed on data
stored in memory. The implementation too was challenging as it required
comparison of string to find matching dates instead of simply extracting
indexes as mentioned in the description for function 2.

To see more details of the code, extracts from the project’s developer
and user guide are included below:

==== 1.     The User Guide shown here provides details on how the commands are used on the client’s side.

 

==== 1.1 Accounts:

The Club Account features a ledger column to record the spending of the
club on any date in the form of DD/MM. There are 4 basic commands
allowing the user to add or delete a ledger, and to credit or debit
money from any date in the list of records.

 

===== 1.1.1 Adding a ledger: addLedger

Adds a ledger to the ledger column.

Format: addLedger d/[DD/MM]

 

Example: addLedger d/ 10/10

 

===== 1.1.2 Deleting a ledger: deleteLedger

Deletes a ledger from the log.

Format: `deleteLedger d/[DD/MM]`

 

Example: `deleteLedger d/ 10/10`

 

===== 1.1.3 Crediting a ledger: credit

Increase the balance of a ledger on a date indicated.

Format: `credit d/[DD/MM] b/[NUM]`

 

Example: `credit d/ 10/10 b/ 100`

 

===== 1.1.4 Debiting a ledger: credit

Decrease the balance of a ledger on a date indicated.

Format: `debit d/[DD/MM] b/[NUM]`

 

Example: `debit d/ 10/10 b/ 100`

==== 2.     The Developer Guide shown here provides details on how the commands are implemented on the developers’ side.

 

==== 2.1 Ledger

As of v1.3, the core commands dealing with Ledgers are addLedger,
deleteLedger, credit and debit. In addition, the common commands such as
undo and redo apply to manipulating the data in the Ledger.

 

Bugs:

{empty}1. Wrong exception thrown when not entering the correct value for
balance fir credit and debit

{empty}2. Balance in ledgers not displaying '$' symbol and 2 decimal
places for cents at the front of the amount of money.

 

3.6.1. Add/Remove Ledger feature

Current Implementation

The add/remove mechanism is facilitated by VersionedAddressBook. It
extends AddressBook with an AddLedger and RemoveLedger method.

 

AddressBook#addLedger() — Adds a ledger object to the UniqueLedgerList.

 

AddressBook#removeLedger() — Removes a ledger object from the
UniqueLedgerList.

 

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as Model#addLedger
and Model#deleteLedger respectively.

 

Below is a scenario of how a user adds a ledger into the club book.

 

Step 1. The user inputs the command addLedger /d [date] /b [balance]
into the command box.

 

Step 2. The commandBox ui will then create a Logic object which parses
the command to ascertain that it is an addLedger command.

 

Step 3. The AddressBookParser will then parse the command to create a
new addLedgerParser object.

 

Step 4. This addLedgerParser will parser the arguments of the command
line and create a new AddLedger object.

 

Step 5. This will then be put into the model, into the versioned address
book.

 

The Ledger class creates an object that instantiates a DateLedger object
and an Account object. The multiple Ledger objects created will be
stored in a UniqueLedgerList, where the uniqueness of every ledger is in
its date.

 

This uniqueness is attained by comparing the DateLedger object in the
ledger to be added and the ledgers already in the UniqueLedgerList using
the getDateLedger() method in Ledger.

 

Perhaps instead of using a for loop to loop through the entire
UniqueLedgerList, one could implement a more efficient method of finding
duplicates while maintaining the function of searching using objects
instead of index.

 

Remove Ledger uses the same concept ut instead starts with looking for
the Ledger in the UniqueLedgerList instead.

 

3.6.2. Credit/Debit feature

The Credit/Debit mechanism is facilitated by CreditCommand and
DebitCommand. They extend Command by overriding and implementing the
execute method.

 

The unique way of implementing this feature is that instead of crediting
or debiting the ledgers in the list using the index, we can directly
perform these operations on the dates themselves.

 

This is done by implementing a for loop to loop through the
UniqueLedgerList to get the date of the ledgers in the list, comparing
them to find one to edit.
